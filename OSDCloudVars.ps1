Sample Script of setting OSDCloud Variables, then triggering OSDCloud using "Start-OSDCloud"
The values you set in the global variable "MyOSDCloud" will be read in by OSDCloud process and applied.

The start of the script, you can do pre-setup on your device
 - Modify BIOS Settings
 - Set or Remove a BIOS Password
 - Wipe drive (OSDCloud will do this anyway)
 - Set OSDCloud Variables

The end of the script is after OSDCloud has run, but before it reboots into the OS (assuming you set the variable to not have OSDCloud reboot your device)
 - This is handy for running any extra OS modifications while offline
   - Remove Built in Apps
   - Add additional drivers via DISM
   - Add offline features / language packs
   - whatever you want to do, be creative

Feel free to make a copy of this script and modify the variables.
If you know to know a full list of variables, look here: https://github.com/OSDeploy/OSD/blob/master/Public/OSDCloud.ps1

#Testing MS Update Catalog Driver Sync

<# 
Used to Determine Driver Pack - OSDCloud will natively do this, so you don't have to, but..
I want to control exactly how drivers are being done, what I'm doing here is..
- Search for Driver Pack, if found, populate the driver pack variable information used in OSDCloud
- Check to see if I have driver packs already downloaded and extracted into the DISM folder on the OSDCloudUSB
  - If I do, Check if I'm wanting to Sync the MS Update Catalog drivers to the USB (Set above), because then I assume I want it to use the MS Catalog to suppliment my own drivers
  - If I do want to sync, set the OSDCloud driver pack variables to use the Microsoft Update Catalog
  - if I don't, set the driver pack to none, so it will ONLY use the drivers I have extracted into my DISM folder on the OSDCloudUSB

Update Files in Module that have been updated since last PowerShell Gallery Build (Testing Only)
This would be if YOU did any modifications to OSDCloud code yourself, and you want to import that before running OSDCloud.
I often do this when I'm developing new features that aren't in the module yet.
